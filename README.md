## Exam Management System 

EMS (Exams Management System) is a system that improves the efficiency of exams
that are given from FM (faculty members) to the students. It saves FM a lot of time
which can be invested in more important things. That saved time comes from semi-
automatic generated exams.
EMS is not limited to generating questions. It even grades exams.
Our system will provide an excellent environment for education by tracking every exam
and the grading of the exam for top management, such as the dean of the college or the
rector of the university as a whole. Making a systematic environment instead of using
only papers can limit the probability of leaking questions or exam papers.
EMS is environment friendly. It can help save many pens, pencils and papers by using a
computer to manage exams and smartphones to solve exams as a student.
The system is be developed on two different platforms. One is web based which will
be used by the FM and CC. It will be more convenient for them to manage questions
and exams. The second one will be mobile based which will be used by students as
they require to use the mobile hardware such as the camera to scan QR codes.
The actors will be divided into 4 types, as follows:
- Administrator: manages accounts and courses.
- CC: manages questions and exams for a course.
- FM: manages exams and grades for his/her section.
- Student: takes exams.

This is a general overview of what the system is able to do:
- Add, edit and delete multiple choice and true or false questions.
- Semi-automatically generate exams by allowing the CC to select questions that
were previously saved in the database depending on the chapters he/she
wanted.
- Manage accounts of users.
- Manage courses.
- Allow the students to take up an exam.
- Display grades of students using a reporting system.
